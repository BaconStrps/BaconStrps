I'm a computer engineering student at Old Dominion University and I am interning at [VMASC](https://vmasc.org/) working under [John Shull](https://github.com/JShull) working on the [Modelling Religious Change Project!](https://mindandculture.org/projects/modeling-social-systems/modeling-religious-change/)

I am extremely interested in how computers function underneath the hood, including bare metal and low-level programming. 

You can find some of my personal projects, and some of my older projects here!
