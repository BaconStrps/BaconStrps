I'm a Project Scientist at [CISCS](https://sics-c.org/)! I currently do R&D relating to radio communications!

I am extremely interested in how computers interact with the real world through analog signal processing and protocols!

I've worked on several projects such as the [Modelling Religious Change Project](https://mindandculture.org/projects/modeling-social-systems/modeling-religious-change/) & [Cyberwind](https://cyberwind.org/).

Currently I am working on several projects relating to EM spectrum security and simulation.

You can find some of my personal projects, and some of my older projects here!
