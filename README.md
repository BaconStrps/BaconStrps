I'm a computer engineering student at Old Dominion University and I am interning at [VMASC](https://vmasc.org/)!

I am extremely interested in how computers function underneath the hood including bare metal and low-level programming as well as working with signals and controls.

I worked on the [Modelling Religious Change Project](https://mindandculture.org/projects/modeling-social-systems/modeling-religious-change/) with [John Shull](https://github.com/JShull) and am currently working with [Peter Foytik](https://github.com/pfoytik) on new exciting projects!

You can find some of my personal projects, and some of my older projects here!
